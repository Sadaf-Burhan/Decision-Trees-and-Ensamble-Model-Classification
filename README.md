# Decision-Trees-and-Ensamble-Model-Classification
The goal of this project was to compare different classification models on the credit card default dataset.
Learning Outcomes:
Understand how to use decision trees on a Dataset to make a prediction
Learning hyper-parameters tuning for decision trees by using RandomGrid
Learning the effectiveness of ensemble algorithms (Random Forest, Adaboost, Extra trees classifier, Gradient Boosted Tree)
First classification trees are used to identify if the credit card client will default or not. The dataset is aimed at the case of customer default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default.
